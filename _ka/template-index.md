# UD for Georgian <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/AQ.svg" /></span>

This is a **work-in-progress** overview of the UD annotation for Georgian.

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In Modern Georgian words are delimited regularly by white spaces and punctuation marks, while in Old Georgian tokenization is an irregular process, in that words are sometimes separated by white spaces and sometimes not, and in some cases, depending on the century, may also be separated by paragraph separators (჻). Punctuation marks may appear: a) in abbreviations (a.š. ‘etc.’, e.i. ‘i.e.’, etc.) and b) in numeric expressions (1.2, 0,5, etc.) and can consist of  a sequence of symbols, such as a question mark followed by an ex-clamation mark (?!), an exclamation mark followed by two full stops (!..) and ellipsis (…).
* Due to rich agglutinating type of morphology, clitics can be considered as separate words. This includes: a) auxiliary verbs (AUX) attached to the nominal paradigm, which add functional and grammatical meaning to the sentence, expressing tense, aspect, mood, etc., b) postpositions  represented by a suffix attached to an inflected nominal (noun, adjective, numeral and pronoun).

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.

## Morphology

### Tags

*

---
**Instruction**: Specify any unused tags. Explain what words are tagged as PART. Describe how the AUX-VERB and DET-PRON distinctions are drawn, and specify whether there are (de)verbal forms tagged as ADJ, ADV or NOUN. Include links to language-specific tag definitions if any.

---

### Features

*

---
**Instruction**: Describe inherent and inflectional features for major word classes (at least NOUN and VERB). Describe other noteworthy features. Include links to language-specific feature definitions if any.

---

## Syntax

*

---
**Instruction**: Give criteria for identifying core arguments (subjects and objects), and describe the range of copula constructions in nonverbal clauses. List all subtype relations used. Include links to language-specific relations definitions if any.

---

## Treebanks

There are [N](../treebanks/LCODE-comparison.html) LANGUAGE UD treebanks:

  * [LANGUAGE-A](../treebanks/LCODE_a/index.html)
  * [LANGUAGE-B](../treebanks/LCODE_b/index.html)

---
**Instruction**: Treebank-specific pages are generated automatically from the README file in the treebank repository and
from the data in the latest release. Link to the respective `*-index.html` page in the `treebanks` folder, using the language code
and the treebank code in the file name.
